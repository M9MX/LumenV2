### Core Systems

#### Forge System
The plugin introduces a Forge system that allows players to craft custom items using Smithing Tables. The system has two modes:

- **Normal Mode**: For reusable crafting of tools and supplies
- **Ritual Mode**: For creating powerful one-time items (takes ~30 minutes and announces to all players)

#### Enhancement System
Players can enhance their items using Catalyst Shards. The enhancement process works by:
1. Holding the target item and Catalyst Shards
2. Shift+Right clicking
3. Each item can be enhanced with up to 5 shards
4. Each shard increases damage, speed, and range of the item

#### Trust System
A team and alliance system that allows players to collaborate:

- **Teams**: Create and manage teams with commands like `/trust team create`, `/trust team invite`, `/trust team info`, and `/trust team leave`
- **Allies**: Form alliances with other teams using commands like `/trust allies add`, `/trust allies accept`, `/trust allies list`, and `/trust allies remove`

### Item Abilities
Custom items come with various abilities activated through different interaction methods:
- **Right Click**: Primary ability activation
- **Swap Hands**: Secondary ability activation
- **Q Key**: Tertiary ability activation
- **Shift+Q**: Item dropping functionality

### Commands
The plugin provides several commands to interact with its systems:
- `/items` - Browse and view available custom items
- `/trust` - Access the trust system for team management
- `/lumen` - Main plugin command

### Resource Pack Integration
The plugin integrates with Minecraft's resource pack system to provide custom models and textures for items, enhancing the visual experience with unique designs for each custom item.

## Getting Started

New players receive a Lumen Guide upon their first join to the server, which provides an introduction to the plugin's systems and features. The guide contains essential information about commands, forge usage, enhancements, abilities, and the trust system.

## How to Obtain Items
